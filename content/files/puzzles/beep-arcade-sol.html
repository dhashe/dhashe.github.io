<h4>Answer: LION</h4>

<p>
  This puzzle takes the form of a mod of
  <a href="https://mattmakesgames.itch.io/celeste-classic-2">
    Celeste Classic 2
  </a>
  for the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> fantasy
  console. In the main <a href="http://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a> game
  the player has a directional <i>dash</i> ability that moves them
  through space in one of eight directions at a constant speed, as well as a
  standard <i>jump</i>. The series also features many optional
  (straw)berries that can be collected by solving especially tricky
  platforming challenges.
</p>
<p>
  In this mod, we find ourselves in a space-themed environment with yellow
  and blue stars instead of berries. Most of the world is initially blocked
  off by heart gates. As we explore, we find items from Celeste that emit
  repeating Morse code messages. We must then repeat the Morse code by
  jumping (dot) and dashing (dash) in the right sequence in order to unlock
  the heart gates. Together the messages spell out MORSE CLOUDS TO STARS,
  which clues the next step.
</p>
<p>
  Each star has exactly one shortest sequence of dashes and jumps, starting
  from the cloud checkpoint, that will successfully collect it. The color of
  the star (yellow or blue) doesn't matter for the puzzle; the difference is
  that blue stars disappear and can't be collected if we dash. When a star
  is collected, a numeric score from 1 to 13 thousand appears next to it.
</p>
<p>
  Treating the solutions for the stars as Morse code letters and ordering by
  the numeric score yields SKY ANIMAL FOUR.
</p>
<p>
  Collecting every star isn't strictly necessary, but if we do collect all
  13 stars then we are rewarded with lines connecting some of the stars.
  Progress on stars is synced with the server and shared across the team.
</p>
<p>
  We must then recognize that the stars form the constellation LEO. As an
  additional clue, the game world is shaped exactly like the IAU definition
  of LEO (constellations are officially defined as areas, not as star
  patterns).
</p>
<p>
  Since LEO is a constellation of a lion (SKY ANIMAL), the
  answer is just <bold>LION</bold>.

<h3>Authors Notes</h3>
<div>
  <p>
    <b>Herman:</b> I was recruited to help develop this puzzle after David
    had a working prototype to help with some level design, art and
    programming. I hope the challenges to collect all the stars managed to
    feel puzzle-y and interesting on their own and that the speed modifier
    made it sufficiently accessible to those who don't usually play
    platformers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tried to fit in a number of references to Celeste. The solid blocks
    have a parallax effect modeled after the dream blocks in Chapter 2. The
    three Morse code objects referred to the computer in Chapter 1, the
    intro car, and the bird.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to working on this puzzle I had used PICO-8 for only one other
    project so I learned a lot while working on this. From a technical
    standpoint, I found it a fun challenge to optimize the dream block
    effect for the game to run efficiently. It was also very cool to
    discover that PICO-8 has a 128-byte array that is shared between the
    system and in Javascript, which is what we made use of for syncing save
    states across the entire team. In theory, it should have been possible
    to even let you see exactly where all your teammates were in the game.

    <b>David:</b> I started this puzzle after learning that Celeste Classic
    2 was written in
    <a href="https://twitter.com/NoelFB/status/1353849211435929600">
      three days
    </a>
    . I can now confirm that the Celeste devs must be very good at this
    since it took us significantly longer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think the idea of doing Morse code with Celeste is a natural one; It
    came to me soon after playing the game for the first time. Shaping the
    map like a constellation and extracting that way came later, and I was
    probably inspired by the similarity between "celeste" and "celestial".
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately, Celeste Classic 2 was a great foundation to build the
    puzzle on. Unfortunately, I still had to spend a lot of time with the
    code replacing Lani's grapple with the original dash, introducing new
    block types like one-way barriers and blue stars, and writing a build
    system to pack the compressed map into the release cart, before I was
    ready to write the actual content of the puzzle.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was honestly pretty tired of the puzzle by that point, so I'm super
    grateful to Herman for coming in and making some awesome star puzzles
    and art, as well as writing the netcode and creating the heart gates and
    audio messages as a solution for guiding solvers towards using Morse for
    extraction. He definitely elevated the puzzle to a much better version
    than I could've made on my own.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the final puzzle, I wrote the star puzzles for the right and left
    levels, and Herman wrote the star puzzles for the top and bottom levels.

    Side note on constellations: The game map really is as-close-as-possible
    to the dimensions of the real Leo constellation. This ended up taking
    some research. It turns out that constellation boundaries are defined
    relative to the Earth's position in 1875, so they are only nice even
    quantities using the B1875.0 celestial coordinate system. But modern
    astronomical software like Stellarium doesn't even include that system
    as an option! I eventually found a
    <a href="http://pbarbier.com/constellations/boundaries.html">
      blog post
    </a>
    with a cleaned dataset of constellation boundaries relative to B1875.0,
    transcribed from the book they were originally published in. I then
    mapped those coordinates onto the 128x128 PICO-8 map.
